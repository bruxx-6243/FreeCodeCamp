                Stephen William Hawking was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, 
                and author who, at the time of his death, was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge

            <h3>A brief story of time</h3>

            <hr>

                <li>Hawking was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford">Oxford</a>, into a family of physicians. In October <strong>1959</strong> <br /> 
                    at the age of 17, he began his university education at University College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA degree in physics. In October 1962, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where in March 1966, he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology. In 1963, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis â€“ ALS, for short) that gradually, over the decades, paralysed him.[19][20] After the loss of his speech, he communicated through a speech-generating device initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle

                    Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose">Roger Penrose</a> Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a major breakthrough in theoretical physics. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.
